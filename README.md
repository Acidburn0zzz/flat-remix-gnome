Flat Remix GNOME theme
===========

This theme is available for use under a Creative Commons ShareAlike license.

Flat remix GNOME theme is a pretty simple shell theme. Its design is mostly flat with a subtle use of shadows, highlights and gradients for some depth.

It was designed specifically for gnome-shell 3.22 but it should work perfectly on any version after gnome-shell 3.16.

This theme was designed to fit with the [Flat Remix icon theme](https://github.com/daniruiz/Super-Flat-Remix).
